# Architecture & Overview

## What is a PRU?

The Programmable Real-Time Unit (PRU) subsystem on the AM335x contains two 200-MHz microcontrollers that run completely independently of the main ARM CPU and the Linux kernel. They are configured, loaded with firmware, and booted from userspace via the Linux **remoteproc** framework. 

Because PRUs do not run an operating system or handle interrupts in the traditional sense, their execution is deterministic and strictly real-time. They can poll pins, manipulate hardware registers, and interact with peripherals at cycle-accurate precision (5 ns per instruction). This allows them to bypass the scheduling jitter and latency of traditional Linux GPIO interrupt handlers, making them suitable for precise hardware timestamping.

## Why not GPIO PPS?

The standard Linux GPIO PPS driver (`pps-gpio`) timestamps the PPS edge in a GPIO interrupt handler. While better than serial PPS, it still goes through the interrupt subsystem, yielding roughly 20 µs dispersion with 10 µs+ outliers under normal system load.

This approach uses **PRU0** to timestamp the PPS edge directly using the IEP (Industrial Ethernet Peripheral) free-running counter at **200 MHz (5 ns/tick)**. The PRU sees the pin transition with minimal interrupt latency by polling `R31` in a tight loop. A userspace daemon reads the timestamp from PRU DRAM via `/dev/mem` and writes it into Chrony's NTP SHM refclock.

**Achieved accuracy:** offsets consistently in the 100–800 ns range, ~1.3 µs calibration spread, bypassing the GPIO interrupt path.

### Component roles

- **PRU** = deterministic edge capture and phase detector. It captures *when* relative to its own clock the PPS edge happened. It produces raw IEP ticks, not wall time.
- **Daemon** = clock-domain bridge. Translates IEP ticks → `CLOCK_REALTIME` nanoseconds via the calibration loop.
- **Chrony** = servo and policy. Takes the phase offset samples and disciplines the system clock. Handles loop filtering, frequency correction, and leap seconds.

### Optional PTP path

The IEP peripheral can also be configured as a PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) via the `pru_iep` kernel driver, exposing it as `/dev/ptpN`. This project does not use that path; it reads the IEP counter directly via `/dev/mem`. However, the same IEP hardware could support IEEE 1588 PTP timestamping if integrated with `linuxptp` instead of Chrony SHM.
